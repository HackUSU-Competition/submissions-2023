"2023/03/25 2:49:56 PM CST","MINDful Hand","1 - 2 Years","MINDful Hand","This project involves creating a mechanical hand using recycled materials that can be controlled by the user's thoughts using brain control technology. The hand is controlled using machine learning algorithms based on data acquired from the user's brain signals. The project uses Python and scikit-learn for machine learning, the Lab Streaming Layer for data acquisition, and an Arduino for hardware control. Pyserial is used to send commands from the Python code to the Arduino to control the movement of the hand. The project aims to promote sustainability by using recycled materials and cutting-edge technology to create a more innovative and sustainable future.","ScikitLearn/sklearn, Pyserial, Muse2, pyLSL, BlueMuse, Lab Recorder, numpy, matplotlib, Stepper.h, BCI_Workshop","https://github.com/AlexBerryhill/MINDful-Hand","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1tys-Eq0Ul1Rv0Oboey_nwtMVoASc8zKw",

A keypad is connected, and will eventually be used to navigate a menu on the display. Light is currently an LED, but can quickly be switched out with a relay to turn on and off a household light.","-MSP432 driverlibs
-Many of the GLCD functions, but some were my own.
-A lot of code snippets from all over the internet, this was more of a project to learn how to program an MSP432.","https://github.com/KoAhauCaleb/light_alarm_drv_lib","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1_iqNW6ZSwPyo3jod2ZAdOw2vycCR0qws",

Using a guitar, I generate electric current which I can then sample through my audio interface hardware to convert it into a digital format. This digital format can be used for many things - from training a generative AI model to quantum resistant encryption.","The application I built uses React as the front-end framework and Vite as the build tool."," Github Repo: https://github.com/dittonjs/usu-hackathon-oscilloscope","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1TmKuZhDcsc7g1DgcBEvxVG3WAD6wPzND",

This involved disabling over 20 feet of CAT 6 cable for wire, soldering over 120 connections, and using a ton of hot glue and electrical tape.


Having no dedicated multiplexer chips meant that we had to squeeze every bit of performance out of our 8-bit microcontroller in order to drive the 5 by 10 matrix at different brightness levels.

A web app and a rust backend makes it easy to play historical data animations on the map. ","Rust https, study serializer, rust tokio , react.js","https://github.com/geo-juicers",,"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vPhjNz_AF1dvpMmovAalhewSnDFsTdvw/view?usp=drivesdk"

The brains of the tractors are ESP32 microcontrollers. The ESP32 controls 2 stepper motors using tank controls to propel, and steer the tractor forward. The esp32 also hosts a wi-fi network. If connected to the tractor wi-fi, an internet browser navigated to 192.168.4.1 a joystick will be displayed. The joystick can then control the tractor, allowing one to get their Zen on and feel relaxed and rested.","Free RTOS, esp async web server, stepper motor, wifi libraries, arduino IDE, chat GPT, fast LED, visual studio code, fusion 360, ultimaker cura","https://github.com/daniel-morty/hackusu2023",,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R83iP5Q-EOI"
