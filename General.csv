Also we learned a lot about the importance of security. Over the 24 hour period our burner email accounts got hacked twice (don't worry we fixed it) we didn't seriously understand how easy it was for a git repo bot to skim our project and find a password hardcoded in our code.

To-do apps have been a hot topic especially within the programming classes at USU. Well now you never need to worry about forgetting to pick up grandma because our team has created a to-do app that will end all to-do apps – TohDoh! 
On the TohDoh web app you can enter your work or class schedule to auto fill into your calendar. Then you can put the various tasks you need to do for work, school, and life with an estimation of how long each will take. TohDoh will then auto-schedule these different tasks as availability permits in your schedule. Your generated schedule can then be imported into any calendar with an .ics file that TohDoh can download to your computer.
