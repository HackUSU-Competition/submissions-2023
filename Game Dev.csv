To showcase this feature, we built a nice park scene complete with a ping-pong table, football, mini golf course, basketball court, and a maze. Users can enjoy playing these games with up to 10 total users. Our scene also included relaxing background music which was filtered out by our recording software so is not found in the video.","Most of our scene assets came from the Unity Asset Store. We did, however, implement the physics and interactions for all the objects ourselves. We also used a package called Normcore to aid with the networking of the HMDs. This was a very hard to find package as we had tried to implement 3-4 other promising packages only to find they did not provide all the functionality we desired for our program.","https://github.com/logan-nielsen/The-Matrix-IRL-HackUSU","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1sXz27F1hYYAGuCZp9h4p216AxI_gBQHD",
