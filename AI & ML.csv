What makes it unique is instead of being accessible via web or mobile app, it is used via SMS and phone call, reachable at (801) 349-3494. This is the first AI assistant I've heard of that can do it's job by having the user ask questions on a phone call, with a response spoken to them. Another feature that makes this chatbot unique is that it can change personalities on request. A user can request it's personality to be pretty much any person, character, or anything else they'd like. This, however, is only available through SMS. 

In addition to the libraries and frameworks described below, I host my project using Flask on my own remote Ubuntu server I have set up, and I used Ngrok to expose the server to the internet securely without punching any holes in my firewall. ","To complete this project, I used:
- Python
- Flask Server
- Twilio Studio Flow
- Twilio Python API
- OpenAI ChatGPT API
- MySQL Server on Microsoft Azure Cloud
- Ngrok
- Ubuntu (used for server hosting)","https://github.com/masoncfrancis/dynamic-chatbot","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1DlJC9tmAkDXBOVt_9H0flaTWKHqLf2_s","https://photos.app.goo.gl/u4daGC2jASCNtVTX6"

We leveraged  a variety of Towards Data Science articles, Medium articles, and an open source kaggle repo. Linked here: https://github.com/cocoxu/Shakespeare/tree/master/data/align/plays/merged

We also utilized the knowledge from arxiv articles to understand the mechanisms behind what we wanted to do. (we did not use their code). Here is an example of an article: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01161.pdf

The Zinc database is a large collection of purchasable compounds that can be used for drug discovery. Traditional methods for identifying potential drug candidates from this database don't work well, though, because the compounds are represented as nodes in a graph with various relationships represented as edges in the graph, such as similarity or chemical properties. By using a GNN and leveraging the graph structure of the database, we aim to overcome these limitations and discover new drugs that could save lives.","Streamlit
