Our program imports historical stock data and historical gdp data from an api.

It then takes that data and computes yearly growth rates in percentages for both the stock data and the gdp data.

Next, it takes the stock growth percentages and compares them to the gdp growth rate percentages for the same year.

Based on the average difference between the stock growth rates and the gdp growth rates, it computes and prints a correlation coefficient for each stock.

Finally, the program prints the stocks with the highest and the lowest correlations to gdp.","I used numpy, json, and requests. 
I also used Alpha vantage api to fetch json data and I used macro trends gdp growth data(https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/gdp-growth-rate)

Los Angeles has a reputation for being one of the most crime-ridden cities in the United States. While the city has made significant progress in reducing crime rates in recent years, it still struggles with a variety of criminal activities, including gang violence, drug trafficking, theft, and property crimes. The city's high population density, economic inequality, and the large number of tourists contribute to the challenges law enforcement faces in maintaining public safety. Despite the efforts of law enforcement agencies and community organizations, crime in Los Angeles remains a serious concern for residents and visitors alike.","ArcGIS, Google Colab, Python, Pandas","https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/04f0a81a3af84462a6d1dc6ef935e9c3","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1Wbwk4coIygeOMv9RPreURawQFHFQPOwj",
